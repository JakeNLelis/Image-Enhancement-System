## üß† Fuzzy Logic System

### Input Variables

1. **Brightness** (0-255): Average pixel luminosity
2. **Contrast** (0-100): Standard deviation of pixel intensities (normalized)
3. **Sharpness** (0-100): Edge detection strength using Laplacian variance
4. **Noise Level** (0-100): High-frequency component intensity

### Output Variables

1. **Brightness Adjustment** (-100 to +100): Amount to add/subtract from pixel values
2. **Contrast Adjustment** (0.5 to 2.0): Multiplier for pixel deviation from mean
3. **Sharpen Amount** (0-100): Intensity of sharpening filter application
4. **Denoise Strength** (0-100): Intensity of noise reduction filter

### Inference Process

1. **Fuzzification**: Convert crisp input values to fuzzy membership degrees
2. **Rule Evaluation**: Apply 50 comprehensive fuzzy rules with AND operations
3. **Implication**: Use minimum implication method to clip output functions
4. **Aggregation**: Combine outputs using maximum operator
5. **Defuzzification**: Apply centroid method to get crisp output values

## üìä Fuzzy Rules Overview

The system implements 50 carefully designed rules covering:

- **Brightness Enhancement Rules** (Rules 1-9): Handle very dark to very bright images
- **Contrast Enhancement Rules** (Rules 10-18): Optimize contrast based on brightness and sharpness
- **Sharpness Enhancement Rules** (Rules 19-29): Balance sharpening with noise levels
- **Noise Reduction Rules** (Rules 30-38): Reduce noise while preserving sharpness
- **Combined Quality Rules** (Rules 39-46): Handle complex multi-variable scenarios
- **Edge Case Rules** (Rules 47-50): Address unusual image characteristics

## üéØ Usage Guide

2. See quantitative improvements in image metrics
3. Download the enhanced image

## üîß Algorithm Details

### Image Analysis Algorithms

#### Brightness Calculation

```typescript
brightness = Œ£(0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B) / totalPixels;
```

#### Contrast Calculation

```typescript
contrast = (standardDeviation(grayValues) / 128) * 100;
```

#### Sharpness Calculation (Laplacian Variance)

```typescript
sharpness = variance(laplacianFilter(image)) normalized to 0-100
```

#### Noise Level Calculation

```typescript
noise = averageLocalVariation(highFrequencyComponents) normalized to 0-100
```

### Enhancement Algorithms

- **Brightness Adjustment**: Direct pixel value modification
- **Contrast Adjustment**: Deviation amplification from mean
- **Sharpening**: Convolution with sharpening kernel
- **Denoising**: Gaussian blur with adaptive radius

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Image Size**: Automatically resizes large images to optimize processing speed
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient canvas operations to minimize memory footprint
- **Processing Time**: Typical enhancement takes 1-3 seconds for standard images
- **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
